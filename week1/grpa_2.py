"""Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory.
It states that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

For Example:

12 = 5 + 7
26 = 3 + 23 or 7 + 19 or 13 + 13

Write a function Goldbach(n) where n is a positive even number (n > 2) that returns 
a list of tuples. In each tuple (a, b) where a â‰¤ b, a and b should be prime numbers and the 
sum of a and b should be equal to n.
